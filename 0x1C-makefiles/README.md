The makefile is a text file that contains the recipe for building your program. It usually resides in the same directory as the sources, and it is usually called Makefile . Each one of these commands should be a separate rule in a makefile.

##What are make, Makefiles

'make' is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading a file called 'Makefile' which contains instructions on how to compile the code. A 'Makefile' typically specifies the dependencies between source files and the commands needed to build the project.

Here is an example of a simple 'Makefile'
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.

myprogram: main.o function1.o function2.o
	$(CC) -o myprogram main.o function1.o function2.o $(CFLAGS)

main.o: main.c
	$(CC) -c main.c

function1.o: function1.c
	$(CC) -c function1.c

function2.o: function2.c
	$(CC) -c function2.c

clean:
	rm -f *.o myprogram

Here is an example of a simple 'Makefile':

```

	$(CC) -o myprogram main.o function1.o function2.o $(CFLAGS)

	$(CC) -c function1.c

function2.o: function2.c
	$(CC) -c function2.c

clean:
	rm -f *.o myprogram
```

In this example, the 'Makefile' defines a target called 'myprogram' that depends on 'main.o', 'function1.o', and 'function2.o'. The commands to compile each source file into object files and link them together to create the executable program 'myprogram' are also specified.

By running the 'make' command in the terminal, 'make' reads the 'Makefile' and executes the necessary commands to build the target specified (in this case, 'myprogram').

Makefiles are commonly used in software development projects to automate the build process and manage dependencies between source files.

##When, Why, and How to use Makefiles
Makefiles are used in software development projects to automate the build process, manage dependencies between source files, and facilitate the compilation of executable programs and libraries. Here is an explanation of when, why, and how to use Makefiles:

When to Use Makefiles:

Use Makefiles when your project consists of multiple source files that need to be compiled and linked together to create an executable program.
Use Makefiles when you want to automate the build process and avoid manually entering compilation commands each time you make changes to your code.
Use Makefiles when you have complex dependencies between source files and want a tool to manage these dependencies efficiently.
Use Makefiles when working on projects that involve repetitive tasks such as compiling, linking, and cleaning up object files.
Why Use Makefiles:

Improve productivity: Makefiles automate the compilation process, saving time and effort for developers.
Manage dependencies: Makefiles track dependencies between source files and only recompile the necessary files when changes are made, reducing build times.
Ensure consistency: Makefiles provide a standardized way to build projects, ensuring that all team members follow the same build process.
Handle complex projects: Makefiles are essential for managing large projects with multiple source files and libraries.
How to Use Makefiles:

Create a 'Makefile' in the root directory of your project with instructions on how to compile the source files and link them together.
Define targets for each executable program or library you want to build, specifying the dependencies and compilation commands for each target.
Use variables to store compiler options, flags, and file paths to make your Makefile more flexible and reusable.
Run the 'make' command in the terminal to execute the commands specified in the Makefile and build your project.
Overall, Makefiles are a powerful tool for automating the build process in software development projects, improving efficiency, managing dependencies, and ensuring consistency across the development team.

##The rules:
Here is an explanation of rules and how to set and use them in Makefiles:

Target:

The target is the file or action that needs to be built or executed. It can be an executable program, a library, or an intermediate file.
The target is followed by a colon (:) in a rule and is the first element in a rule.
Dependencies:

Dependencies are the files or actions that the target depends on. If any of the dependencies change, the target needs to be rebuilt.
Dependencies are listed after the target in a rule, separated by spaces.
Commands:

Commands are the actions that need to be executed in order to build the target from its dependencies.
Commands are listed on the lines following the target and dependencies, preceded by a tab character.
Here is an example of a rule in a Makefile:

myprogram: main.o function1.o function2.o
    gcc -o myprogram main.o function1.o function2.o
In this rule:

'myprogram' is the target.
'main.o', 'function1.o', and 'function2.o' are the dependencies.
The command 'gcc -o myprogram main.o function1.o function2.o' is the command to build 'myprogram' from its dependencies.
To set and use rules in a Makefile:

Define a rule with the target, dependencies, and commands.
Make sure to use a tab character (not spaces) before each command line.
Save the Makefile in the root directory of your project.
Run the 'make' command in the terminal to execute the rules and build the specified targets.
Rules are essential components of Makefiles that define how targets are built from their dependencies. By setting and using rules effectively in Makefiles, you can automate the build process, manage dependencies, and compile your projects efficiently.
