A Doubly linked list is a bidirectional linked list; i.e., you can traverse it from head to tail node or tail to head node. Unlike singly-linked lists, its node has an extra pointer that points at the last node.
=======
A doubly linked list of singly linked lists is a data structure that consists of a set of singly linked lists (SLLs), each of which is doubly linked. It is used to store data in a way that allows for fast insertion and deletion of elements. Each SLL is made up of two parts: a head and a tail.
